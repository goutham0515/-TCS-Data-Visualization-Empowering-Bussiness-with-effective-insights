# Data Visualization:Empowering Bussiness with effective insights

There are four tasks we have to complete tha tasks to reach the distination

# 1st task
## Framing the Business Scenario

Overview the complete information about the tasks
Creating  a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Make sure you differentiate your questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses.

Questions of interest to the CEO

01. Which region is generating the highest revenue, and which region is generating the lowest?

02. What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease?

03. Which months generated the most revenue? Is there a seasonality in sales?

04. Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue? Is the business dependent on these customers or is the customer base diversified?

05. What is the percentage of customers who are repeating their orders? Are they ordering the same products or different?

06. For the repeat customers, how long does it take for them to place the next order after being delivered the previous one?

07. What revenue is being generated from the customers who have ordered more than once?

08. Who are the customers that have repeated the most? How much are they contributing to revenue?


## 2nd task
## Choosing the Right Visuals

1Q) The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the entire year. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year. Which visual would most likely help the CEO analyse the data?

 Ans : A line chart is used to represent repeated measurements taken over regular time intervals. 

2Q) The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, as a subcomponent, they would also like to see which products are contributing to the total revenue being generated by each country. Which visual would enable the CMO to view the revenue for each country and the breakdown by products on a single chart?

 Ans :  A stacked bar chart would be used here as the chart allows users to compare subcomponent pieces across different categories. 

3Q) The CEO of the online retail store wants to see how much average revenue is generated by each country. They are interested in viewing the following metrics on the visual: Minimum value First quartile value Median value Third quartile value Maximum value Which chart would you create to show the above metrics for the average revenue generated by each country?

Ans : The box plot would show the distribution of data based on a five number summary (“minimum”, first quartile, median, third quartile, and “maximum”). 

4Q) The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. They are interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products. Which visual would help the CMO understand the data on revenue generated by the top 10 customers?

Ans : Column charts are used to display comparisons between different items.

5Q): The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. They want to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, they will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. Which chart would be most useful to provide the CEO information on the demand in each region?

Ans : The map chart will have all the countries on a single map and the demand will be displayed by highlighting the area of each country. 

## 3rd task
## Creating Effective Visuals

creating the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. Using Power BI to create the visuals and we’ve provided the data in the resources below. 

## Data cleanup

2) Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0
